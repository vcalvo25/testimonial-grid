- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
In this challenge, I learned how to use CSS grid to create a responsive layout that works on a range of screens sizes. Additionally, I learned in-depth about the basic grid commands such as grid-template-columns, and grid-column or grid-row shorthand. This helped my understanding greatly as it allowed me to accurately organize the cards on the grid without guessing.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Basics MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Basic_concepts_of_grid_layout)) - This resource helped me out greatly in understanding the basics such as "fr" and repeat, and how to use the inspector tool to toggle the row/column and gap lines.
